# DESIGN PATTERNS 

a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 
It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for 
how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer 
can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. ( Someone has already solved your problems. )

#### design principles

 * classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
